*<p>A sentimental analyzer for overcoming the challenges to identify the twitter tweets text sentiments (positive, negative) by implementing a neural network using tensorflow.</p>*
Millions of people are using are using Twitter and expressing their emotions like happiness, sadness, anger etc. The sentiment analysis is all about detecting the emotions, opinion, assesssment, attitudes, and took this into consideration as a human think. Sentiment analysis classfies the emotions into classes such as positive or negative.

**<p>Twitter sentiment analysis based on the NLP (natural language processing) field. For tweets text, we use NLP techniques like tokenizing the words, removing the stop words like I, me, my, our, your, is, was, etc. Natural language processing also plays a part to preprocess the data like cleaning the text and removing the special characters and punctuation marks. Sentimental analysis is very important because we can know the trends of peopleâ€™s emotions on specific topics with their tweets.</p>**
**<p> Evolution Measures:</p>**
<p>After training the model, I have applied the evaluation measures to check how the model is getting predictions. I have used the following eavaluation measures to evaluate the performance of the models.</p>
